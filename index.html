                    <h3>Guess the Number Game</h3>
                    <p>I developed this game that upon page load it prompts the user to pick a number. Once the number is picked the program then generates a random number in between 1 and the user selected number. The user then tries to guess the random number, and after each guess there is a promt that lets the user know wether to guess higher or lower number. Once the random number is guessed, the page congragulates the user and lets them know how many guesses it took them and what their guesses were. This program is also coded to not allow the user to input anything other than a positive integer in between the appropriate range.</p>
